Antigravity collapses the same activity into:
•  "Worked for 28s ▼" — one-line collapsible session header
•  "Explored 2 commands ▼" — grouped tool runs
•  "Thought for 8s ›" — chain-of-thought panel
•  Tool calls rendered as cards (header bar, content, exit code, "Always run") not stream-of-text
•  Final prose rendered as rich markdown, isolated from the tool log

Concrete cosmetic deltas to close (in priority order):

1. Phase grouping. Wrap each agent turn into a single "Worked for Ns ▾" collapsible block; everything between user prompt and final answer collapses by default. Tool log only opens on click.
2. Card-style tool rendering. → tool_name({...json...}) is too noisy. Replace with a one-line summary card: tool name, human-readable args (web_search "AI code verification 2026"), result-size pill, exit/ok glyph.
3. Suppress shell prompt leakage. Lines like stevenmorales@Stevens-Mac-mini-2 StellarumAtlas % are drifting into the agent stream. Should never appear inside an agent turn.
4. Markdown render in xterm output. Final answer is plaintext-with-asterisks; should render headings, bullets, and inline code chips like Antigravity does (we already render audit findings with ANSI; same machinery should run on agent prose).
5. "Files Modified" footer. Antigravity's bottom-of-turn artifact list is a great pattern for /build and /fix turns — surface a tiny Files Modified ⓘ chip with the changed paths.

Items 1–3 are the highest-leverage and don't touch agent semantics — pure xterm presentation. Worth queuing as the next bite-sized polish pass.

## Resizable layout (must-do, not optional)

The current shell is fixed-grid: `.blocks-sidebar` width and the file-preview height are hard-coded in CSS. This is fine as a v0 but breaks down the moment a real workspace shows up — long file paths in the tree get clipped, audit findings push the file preview below the fold, etc.

What we need:

1. **Sidebar width drag-handle.** A 4–6px hit zone on the right edge of `.blocks-sidebar`. Drag persists per-workspace into `<cwd>/.prism/state.json` (under a new `layout` key) so reopening the project restores the user's width. Min ~180px, max ~50% of viewport.
2. **File-preview horizontal divider.** When the preview overlay is open, give it a draggable top edge so the user can give it more room without dismissing it. Same persistence story.
3. **Problems-panel width.** Already a sibling pane on the right; same treatment.
4. **Snap points.** Double-click on a divider snaps to a sensible default (sidebar 240px, preview 50% height). Cheap, high signal.
5. **Keyboard parity.** `Cmd+Opt+[` / `Cmd+Opt+]` nudge the focused divider in 16px steps so resize is reachable without a mouse.

Implementation note: do this in vanilla JS pointer-event handlers on the dividers, not a library. We already have a workspace-scoped `ResizeObserver` driving `fitTerminalWithGutter()` — the new dividers just write `--sidebar-width` / `--preview-height` CSS custom properties on the workspace root, and the existing observer picks up the size change. Persistence piggybacks on the workspace-state plumbing landing in the "persisted workspace state" ticket, so no new IPC.

## Rounded code-block cards (deferred — needs HTML overlay)

In modern AI-tool UIs (Cursor, Claude desktop, Antigravity), assistant
prose has two stylistic moves we don't yet match in xterm:

1. **Inline code** (file paths, identifiers, ` `foo.ts` `) is rendered in
   a contrasting color, monospace inside otherwise-proportional prose.
2. **Fenced code blocks** are wrapped in rounded containers with a soft
   tinted background.

**#1 — Inline code coloring** is feasible inside xterm via ANSI
escape codes. Implemented in `agent.ts`'s `onToken` streaming layer
with a small backtick state-machine (handles tokens that split across
chunks, distinguishes single from triple backticks). Cyan-on-default
gives the right visual weight without competing with the prose color.

**#2 — Rounded containers** are NOT feasible in pure xterm. xterm
renders character cells; it cannot draw rounded rectangles or
background tints that span partial cells. Two paths exist:

  - **ANSI-only fake**: emit Unicode box-drawing characters (`╭─╮│ │╰─╯`)
    around fenced code. Looks decent in mono terminals but no real
    rounded corners, no background tint, doesn't match modern UIs.

  - **HTML overlay** (proper way): when a fenced code block streams in,
    intercept the tokens, suppress them from xterm, and render a
    `<div class="code-card">` overlay above the terminal with real CSS
    `border-radius` + bg tint. This is what HTML-based AI tools
    (Cursor, Claude desktop) do because they're not terminal-based.
    For Prism it is a **bigger architectural shift** — code blocks
    become DOM nodes outside xterm's text grid, which means:
      - layout has to flow around them (the terminal grid stops
        being the only renderer)
      - selection, copy/paste, search inside the card need their own
        DOM-level handlers
      - vertical scroll has to be coordinated across xterm + cards

**Recommended deferral**: pick this up alongside **Phase 2 of the IDE
shell** (the tabbed CodeMirror editor pane). At that point the
renderer for assistant prose moves from xterm to a CodeMirror-based
component anyway, and rounded code-block cards come essentially free
from the existing CodeMirror styling. Doing it earlier would mean
building a one-off card renderer that we'd throw away at IDE Phase 2.

Until then, Prism users see fenced code blocks as raw monospace text
inside xterm, which is fine for terminal-native workflows but doesn't
match the modern AI-tool feel for prose-heavy assistant responses.

Short answer: after the test campaign + first beta cohort, before public launch.

Why not now
•  Daily-driver UX still has rough edges (chat readability, save/load, modal flow). Stabilize the terminal-native experience first.
•  Phase 2 is ~3–6 weeks of work. Adds layout coordination (xterm + DOM editor), file open/save flow, dirty-buffer tracking, undo/redo, syntax highlighting, save-via-approval. None of that helps you finish the eval campaign.
•  The wedge is verification, not editing. Every week you ship Phase 2 instead of audit polish is a week competitors aren't worried about you.

Why not later than launch
•  Once Prism brands as "the verification layer," users will ask "can I edit here?" within minutes of trying it. Without an editor pane the tool feels half-finished for a serious workflow.
•  Code-block rendering polish (the deferred #2) compounds well with Phase 2; doing it before is wasted work.

The trigger
•  Test campaign across 4–6 LLMs is complete and you've shipped fixes from those findings.
•  5+ external beta testers have used Prism daily for ≥1 week and the chat/audit/load surface is genuinely smooth.
•  Then start Phase 2 — and ship code-block cards with it.

Concretely: probably 2–4 weeks from now, not tonight, not next month.

Then start now, smaller scope. You are your own beta cohort, and dogfooding is the strongest market signal anyway.

Minimum dogfood-able editor: ~1 week, not 3-6

•  Open file → edit → save (already have approval flow + read_file_text + write_file_text plumbing).
•  Single CodeMirror pane, no tabs.
•  Reuse the CodeMirror instance you already configured for the input bar; just unlock multi-line mode + add file-open binding.
•  Cmd+S = save via approval. Cmd+W = close pane.
•  No find-replace, no undo polish, no LSP squiggles, no diff view. Those stack later.

That's a real editing surface you can use this week. The "polished v1 for the public" is what the 3-6 weeks goes toward — multi-file tabs, dirty-buffer tracking, find-replace, LSP, code-block cards, save-via-approval-with-batching, etc. But none of that is required for you to start using Prism as your editor today.

Reframed order
1. Ship the 1-week MVP editor pane this coming week.
2. Use it to build Prism + Atlas + your CRM for ~2 weeks. Notice what hurts.
3. Fix the top 3 paper cuts you actually hit.
4. Then the polish/launch sprint with confidence that the things you're polishing are real, not speculated.

Founder dogfooding > beta cohort feedback for v0. The "wait for beta cohort" advice was wrong for this project — you're not optimizing for the median user, you're optimizing for you, and "you" happens to be a representative dev-tool power user. Trust that.
